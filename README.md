# Game-of-life-simulator

The Game of Life Simulator is a program that simulates Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton
that models the evolution of a grid of cells based on simple rules. Each cell can either be alive or
dead and transitions state depending on the states of its neighbour’s. The objective is to build a
feature-rich, interactive, and efficient simulator capable of handling user-defined configurations,
dynamic grid sizes, and real-time visualization of the simulation’s evolution.
